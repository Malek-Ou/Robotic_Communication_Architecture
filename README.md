# Communication Architecture for an Autonomous Mobile Robot

## Project Overview

This project aims to design and simulate a robust **communication architecture** for an **exploration mobile robot** operating in constrained environments such as tunnels.  
The approach relies on a **mobile ad hoc network (MANET)** using the **OLSR routing protocol** and modern **Wi-Fi communication technologies**.

---

## Objectives

- Address communication challenges in infrastructure-less environments (tunnels, mines, disaster zones).  
- Propose a MANET-based solution ensuring reliable and adaptive robot-to-robot communication.  
- Leverage network simulation to analyze performance under realistic mobility and propagation conditions.

---

## Technologies Used

- **ns-3** — Network simulator for MANET modeling and testing.  
- **Wireshark + Pcap** — Packet capture and network analysis.  
- **Wi-Fi (802.11n)** — High-throughput wireless standard suitable for underground communications.

### Propagation Models
- **Friis model** — Free-space propagation.  
- **LogDistance model** — Signal attenuation with distance and obstacles.

### Mobility Model
- **RandomWaypointMobilityModel** — Realistic simulation of mobile robots in tunnels.

### Routing Protocol
- **OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing)** — Efficient routing for mobile ad hoc networks.

## Implementation Process

1. Preliminary study of communication architectures for mobile robotics.  
2. Selection of technologies: MANET + Wi-Fi 802.11n + OLSR.  
3. ns-3 setup and configuration (mobility, propagation, routing).  
4. Simulation, data capture (Wireshark), and performance analysis.  
5. Evaluation of throughput, latency, and packet loss.

## ns-3 Simulation Optimization

To improve realism and performance:

- **Wi-Fi 802.11n**: increased range and throughput.  
- **Friis + LogDistance models**: combined propagation effects.  
- **RandomWaypointMobilityModel**: variable speeds and pauses.  
- **OLSR**: quick route discovery and adaptive reconvergence.

---

## Results

- Operational MANET communication in simulated tunnel conditions.  
- Demonstrated stability of Wi-Fi 802.11n under constrained environments.  
- OLSR protocol provided robust routing with minimal latency.  
- Optimized parameters reduced packet loss and improved throughput.

## Context & Motivation

The project addresses the need for **reliable communication systems** in **robotic exploration of underground environments**.  
In the absence of traditional infrastructure, **MANET networks** provide flexibility, scalability, and resilience.

---

## Limitations & Challenges

**Limitations:**
- Random mobility cannot fully represent physical tunnel constraints.  
- Complex multi-path interferences are not modeled.

**Challenges:**
- Fine-tuning mobility parameters to avoid unrealistic clustering.  
- Managing energy consumption from frequent OLSR messaging.

---

## Potential Applications

- Robotic exploration in tunnels, mines, and caves.  
- Rapid deployment of emergency communication networks.  
- Research on routing protocols in dynamic and constrained environments.

## File Descriptions

### `animation-interface.cc`
- C++ file managing the **interface with NetAnim**.  
- NetAnim is a visualization tool for ns-3 that allows viewing node movement, packet exchanges, and network connections.  
- This file usually contains the code that configures the simulation to send data to NetAnim for animation.

### `manet-simulation finale.pcap`
- A **PCAP file (Packet Capture)**.  
- Contains network packets captured during a MANET simulation.  
- Can be opened with **Wireshark** to analyze network traffic, check protocols, latency, and packet loss.

### `manet-simulation.cc`
- The **main simulation file** in C++ for ns-3.  
- Configures mobile nodes, topology, MANET protocol (e.g., OLSR or AODV), traffic, and simulation duration.  
- May also export results to PCAP or NetAnim.

### `netanim-test.cc`
- A **test file** used to verify **NetAnim integration**.  
- Tests node animation and traffic visualization without running the full simulation.

### `scratch-simulator.cc`
- A **prototype or testing file (“scratch”)** for experimenting with new ideas or functions before integrating them into the main simulation.  
- May contain code to test mobility models, protocols, or network configurations.

---

## Quick Summary

- `.cc` → C++ files with simulation or animation code.  
- `.pcap` → Captured network traffic generated by the simulation.  
- Some files are for the **main simulation** (`manet-simulation.cc`), others for **animation or testing** (`animation-interface.cc`, `netanim-test.cc`, `scratch-simulator.cc`).

---

## How to Run

1. Install **ns-3** (version 3.38 or later recommended).  
2. Place the `.cc` files inside the `scratch/` directory of ns-3.  
3. Build and run the simulation:
   ```bash
   ./ns3 run scratch/manet-simulation.cc
